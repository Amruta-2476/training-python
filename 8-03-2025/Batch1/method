difference between method and fuction 
= function is called using calling function
= method called using dot operator with object



python supports all types inheritance, java does not support multiple nheritance
give example of multiple inheritance..? bcoz the issue that if A class has add method, B class also has add method. so their child class will have kiska add method
iska solution is interface

multiple inheritance mein... pehle jo class a rha hai like 
class C(A,B):    So A ka method will be considered
